# Tomato Leaf Disease Prediction

## Project Description
This project is a web-based application that uses deep learning to predict diseases in tomato leaves from uploaded images. It employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the disease and suggests organic treatment options. The system is designed for quick and accurate disease diagnosis, aimed at aiding farmers and agricultural professionals in improving crop health.
